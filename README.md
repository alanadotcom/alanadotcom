## Hi there, I'm Alana!


## Introduction
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio where I will document everything that relates to my learning journey-- including projects, tools used, screenshots, and results. I am an aspiring SOC Analyst who is currently building hands-on experience in blue team operations, threat detection, and incident response through platforms like TryHackMe, Splunk, and home lab projects.  

What draws me to cybersecurity is the real-world impact. Every log, alert, or threat detected matters. In this season of my life, I am currently allowing myself to approach every challenge with open arms, so I appreciate the fact that this field is continously evolving and there will always be something new to learn. 

## Objectives
The goals of this repository are to provide proof of my technical and investigative skills, to share my growth, and to build a resource that I can share with whoever needs it. All work is done in home labs or sandboxed environments.
